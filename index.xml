      <description>In this note we will approach light transport in two directions. The first is from the perpective of simulation and modelling, the other is from the perspective of vision and inference. We will see different forms of light transport equation that connect these two aspects. I hope this note will help who wants to understand light transport in a mostly high-level fashion.
1. A conceptual tour in physically based rendering To some extent, creating photo-realistic renderings means understanding our visual perceptions, which are likely to be evolving as our knowledge advances, and accordingly we will make improvements to the corresponding rendering models.</description>
